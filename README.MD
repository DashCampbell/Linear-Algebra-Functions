# Linear Algebra Functions
A small scale python library that can perform linear algebra.

## Features
### Vector Class
* Basic vector arithmetic
* Dot product
* Cross product
* Vector projection
* Obtaining an orthonormal basis

### Matric Class
* Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
* Calculating the inverse matrix
* Calculating the determinate
* Calculating the transpose

## Example Implementation

## Notes
* If multiplying or dividing a matrix/vector by a scalar value, the scalar value needs to be on the right side of the matrix/vector.
* Complex numbers are treated as scalars in this library.
